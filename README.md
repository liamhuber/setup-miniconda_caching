A simple workflow to demonstrate that there is an edge case (having a range of `python` specified in your env file) can cause the [documented suggestion](https://github.com/conda-incubator/setup-miniconda?tab=readme-ov-file#caching-environments) for caching envs with `conda-incubator/setup-miniconda` can cause the `python-version` action input to be ignored. A safer alternative using a `lookup-only` cache check and exploiting the `environment-file` for new env builds avoids this problem.
